## Details for teaching team
My first attempt was too large of an application and way outside my skill-set so I settelled on something I knew I could at least complete and turn in meeting the requirements in the last 2 days before it was due. I re-worked and worked with my original plan for a long time and restarted from scratch, but something continually failed in my database structure and then I kept messing up my views and controllers trying to fix things, which just broke more things. I finally had to give it up for a lost cause and by then I was sick of the subject and wanted something new to work with, plus this will actually be useful to me in tracking the oils I've bought.

I wish my internet didn't break when I was trying to upload my demo to get the link. Fantastic.
